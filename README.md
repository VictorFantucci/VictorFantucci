## Welcome to my GitHub Profile

### About myself:

Graduating in Electrical Engineering at the College of Engineering of GuaratinguetÃ¡, institute of the University Estadual Paulista "JÃºlio de Mesquita Filho" (UNESP).

For me, it's all about the big picture. Therefore, I developed a passion for using data and common sense to generate simple and implementable solutions to complex problems. I am fascinated with increasingly quantitative decision making. I made it my mission to keep up to date with the latest technologies and analytical techniques.

I seek solutions to problems in the most diverse areas, especially engineering and business. Through these experiments I am building an arsenal of analytical techniques to be a complete Data Scientist.
